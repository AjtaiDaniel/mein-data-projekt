# My Data Project 🐟

This project explores the relationship between physical measurements of fish and their weight using exploratory data analysis and a simple linear regression model.

## Project Overview

**Problem Statement:**  
Fish weight varies substantially across species and individuals, and it is not immediately clear how strongly physical measurements are related to weight.

**Goal:**  
The goal of this project is to explore how physical characteristics of fish relate to their weight and to assess whether a simple linear regression model can describe this relationship.

**Methods:**  
The analysis is based on exploratory data analysis (descriptive statistics and visualizations) and a simple linear regression using Python, pandas, matplotlib, and statsmodels.

## Dataset

### Dataset Description

The Fish dataset contains measurements of 159 individual fish from seven different species.  
Each observation represents a single fish and includes both categorical and numerical variables.

The categorical variable `Species` identifies the fish species, while the numerical variables describe physical characteristics such as weight, multiple length measurements, height, and width. All measurements are continuous and recorded in consistent units.

The dataset is well suited for exploratory data analysis, as it allows for the investigation of differences between species as well as the relationship between physical dimensions and fish weight.
